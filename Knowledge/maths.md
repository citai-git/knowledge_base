### [Category Theory for Scientists](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-s996-category-theory-for-scientists-spring-2013/textbook/)

**authors:** David Spivak.

**year:** 2013.

**abstract**: An introduction to category theory as a rigorous, flexible, and coherent modeling language that can be used across the sciences. Category theory was invented in the 1940s to unify and synthesize different areas in mathematics, and it has proven remarkably successful in enabling powerful communication between disparate fields and subfields within mathematics. This book shows that category theory can be useful outside of mathematics as a rigorous, flexible, and coherent modeling language throughout the sciences. Information is inherently dynamic; the same ideas can be organized and reorganized in countless ways, and the ability to translate between such organizational structures is becoming increasingly important in the sciences. Category theory offers a unifying framework for information modeling that can facilitate the translation of knowledge between disciplines. Written in an engaging and straightforward style, and assuming little background in mathematics, the book is rigorous but accessible to non-mathematicians. Using databases as an entry to category theory, it begins with sets and functions, then introduces the reader to notions that are fundamental in mathematics: monoids, groups, orders, and graphs-categories in disguise. After explaining the "big three" concepts of category theory-categories, functors, and natural transformations-the book covers other topics, including limits, colimits, functor categories, sheaves, monads, and operads. The book explains category theory by examples and exercises rather than focusing on theorems and proofs. It includes more than 300 exercises, with solutions. Category Theory for the Sciences is intended to create a bridge between the vast array of mathematical concepts used by mathematicians and the models and frameworks of such scientific disciplines as computation, neuroscience, and physics.

**description:** This book attempts to explain category theory concepts in simple terms, which are accessible to non-mathematicians. Concepts and definitions are well motivated and explained by examples.

### [Seven Sketches in Compositionality: An Invitation to Applied Category Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05316)

**authors:** Brendan Fong, David Spivak.

**year:** 2018

**abstract:** This book is an invitation to discover advanced topics in category theory through concrete, real-world examples. It aims to give a tour: a gentle, quick introduction to guide later exploration. The tour takes place over seven sketches, each pairing an evocative application, such as databases, electric circuits, or dynamical systems, with the exploration of a categorical structure, such as adjoint functors, enriched categories, or toposes.

**notes:** This is the course textbook for the 2019 open-source MIT course [Applied Category Theory](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-s097-applied-category-theory-january-iap-2019/ "Link to MIT course."); the open-source course materials include recorded lectures. No prior knowledge of category theory is assumed.

### [An Introduction to Groups, Groupoids and Their Representations](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Introduction-Groups-Groupoids-Their-Representations-ebook/dp/B07ZPFP753/ "Unfortunately, an open-sourced copy of this book has not been found.")

**authors:**  Alberto Ibort, Miguel Rodriguez.

**year:** 2019

**abstract:** This book offers an introduction to the theory of groupoids and their representations encompassing the standard theory of groups. Using a categorical language, developed from simple examples, the theory of finite groupoids is shown to knit neatly with that of groups and their structure as well as that of their representations is described. The book comprises numerous examples and applications, including well-known games and puzzles, databases and physics applications. Key concepts have been presented using only basic notions so that it can be used both by students and researchers interested in the subject.
